which it has been engaged, particularly specifying
any Achievement it may have performed, and the
Colours, Trophies, &amp;c., it may have captured from

<h2 class="nobreak lsp2" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of
this desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds
with which the Military History of our country abounds.
To hold forth these bright examples to the imitation of the
youthful soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the
meritorious conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have given
rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the “London Gazette,” from whence they are
transferred into the public prints: the achievements of our
armies are thus made known at the time of their occurrence,
and receive the tribute of praise and admiration to which
they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions, the Houses
of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for
their skill and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by
the high honour of their Sovereign’s Approbation, constitute
the reward which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular
records of their services and achievements. Hence some
difficulty has been experienced in obtaining, particularly
from the old Regiments, an authentic account of their origin
and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its
services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will
henceforth derive information as to the difficulties and
privations which chequer the career of those who embrace
the military profession. In Great Britain, where so large a
number of persons are devoted to the active concerns of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and where these
pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed by the
<i>presence of war</i>, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part
of the globe, with little or no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the
agriculturist and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be
supposed not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the
soldier and the sailor,—on their sufferings,—and on the
sacrifice of valuable life, by which so many national benefits
are obtained and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and
endurance, have shone conspicuously under great and trying
difficulties; and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they
have effected debarkations in spite of the most formidable
opposition, and by the gallantry and steadiness with which
they have maintained their advantages against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant
exertions of the Corps employed; but the details of their
services, and of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully
given in the Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General’s Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting
to military men of every rank, it is considered that they will
also afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in the
Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i>Esprit de Corps</i>—an
attachment to every thing belonging to their Regiment;
to such persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps
cannot fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the
actions of the great,—the valiant,—the loyal, have always
been of paramount interest with a brave and civilized people.
Great Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments
of danger and terror, have stood, “firm as the rocks
of their native shore;” and when half the World has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a
record of achievements in war,—victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen,—our brothers,—our
fellow-citizens in arms,—a record which revives the memory
of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds before us, will
certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their
respective Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which
have, from time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment,
as testifying the value and importance of its services,
will be faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up
in numerical succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>The last twelve years of the eighteenth century
form a period, remarkable in the annals of Europe,
for the efforts made to overthrow the governments of
Christendom, and to establish the destructive domination
of atheism and democracy, upon the ruins of
institutions which had elevated the inhabitants of this
quarter of the globe to an height of knowledge,
refinement, wealth, and power, unknown in other
parts of the earth. France was the great theatre
of commotion: there the war of hostile principles
produced the most sanguinary results;—the cry of
“equality” was raised,—the blood of princes, nobles,
and citizens was shed, and democracy appeared to
triumph over the rights of society. In other countries,
republican principles were spreading to an alarming
extent; the sovereigns of Europe were forced to engage
in war to oppose the progress of destruction, and to
Great Britain pertains the honour of having persevered
in this contest, for twenty years, when the overthrow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
that tyrannical power which sprung out of the French
revolution, was accomplished.</p>

<p>On the commencement of hostilities in 1793, the
British army was augmented: upwards of fifty regiments
of foot were raised, and one of the first corps
embodied, on this occasion, was the regiment which
now bears the title of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth, or the
Royal County Down Regiment</span>.</p>

<p>This corps was raised by Major-General Cornelius
Cuyler, who had served with reputation in North
America, and also in the West Indies, where he
had performed the duties of commander-in-chief; its
general rendezvous was at Shrewsbury, and its designation
was “<span class="smcap">General Cuyler’s Shropshire Volunteers</span>;”
but its ranks were completed with men, principally
from Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cheshire,—counties
which have furnished many excellent soldiers.
Major-General Cuyler’s appointment was dated the
30th of October, 1793, and the royal warrants for
raising recruits were issued on the following day<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>In February, 1794, the following officers were holding
commissions in the regiment:—</p>

<p class="p1">From Shrewsbury, the regiment proceeded to Park-gate,
where it embarked, in April, for Ireland, and after
landing at Cork, marched to Kilkenny.</p>

<p>At this period the newly-raised corps were numbered,
and this regiment received the designation of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, or <span class="smcap">Shropshire Volunteers</span>.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, 1794, Major-General Cuyler
was appointed to the Sixty-ninth Regiment, and was
succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, by
Lieutenant-General Russell Manners.</p>

<p>After remaining in Ireland ten weeks, the regiment
embarked at Cork, and was held in readiness for active<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
service; but it landed at Frome, in Somersetshire, in
September, and proceeded from thence to the Isle of
Wight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The regiment having been brought into a state of
discipline and efficiency, was selected to serve on board
the fleet as marines; eight officers, and four hundred
and fourteen non-commissioned officers and soldiers,
embarked in January, 1795, on board the “Prince of
Wales,” “Triumph,” “Brunswick,” and “Hector,”
line-of-battle ships, and in February, seven officers, and
two hundred and seventy-six non-commissioned officers
and soldiers, embarked on board the “Prince,” “Saturn,”
and “Boyne.” The “Boyne” caught fire at Spithead,
and was destroyed, when the grenadier company of the
regiment lost its arms, accoutrements, and baggage.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Russell Manners was removed to the
Twenty-sixth Light Dragoons, in March, 1795, and was
succeeded by Major-General William Grinfield, from
Lieut.-Colonel in the Third Foot Guards.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment were at Newport,
in the Isle of Wight, where they were inspected by His
Royal Highness the Duke of York, who expressed his
approbation of their appearance; and in October the
establishment was augmented to one hundred rank and
file per company, its numbers being completed by
drafts from the 118th and 121st Regiments; the men
of the last-mentioned corps were then recently liberated
from French prison. In December, the regiment was
stationed at Portsmouth and Hilsea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1796, the establishment was
augmented to twelve companies,—the eleventh and
twelfth being recruiting companies; and as the ships of
war came into port, the officers and soldiers of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> landed and joined the regiment; they
had served in several engagements in which the ships
they were embarked in had taken part, during that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
eventful period. In April, the regiment proceeded to
Guildford, and in June it returned to the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Flanders and Holland had embraced
the republican principles of France, and the British
government resolved to deprive the Dutch of the
settlement of the Cape of Good Hope; the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
embarked for the Cape, where they landed on the
22nd of September, six days after the Dutch governor
had surrendered the colony to the forces under General
Sir Alured Clarke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797<br />1798<br />1799</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed at the Cape of Good
Hope during the years 1797 and 1798, and received
drafts from the 95th, and other corps. In February,
1799, it embarked for the East Indies, and landed, on
the 10th of May, at Madras, upwards of thirteen hundred
strong,—a splendid body of men, whose appearance
excited much admiration.</p>

<p>The capture of Seringapatam had rendered the services
of the regiment at this station unnecessary, and
after a month’s repose at Madras, it embarked for
Bombay, where it arrived on the 22nd of July, and sent
detachments by sea, under Major Bell, and Captain
James Richardson, to Tannah and Surat: these detachments
returned to Bombay, in December following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800<br />1801</div>

<p>From Bombay, three companies sailed, towards the
end of 1800, for Ceylon, in the expectation of taking
part in the reduction of the Isle of France<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; but orders
had, in the meantime, arrived for an army from India,
to co-operate with a body of troops from Europe, in
the expulsion of the French “<span class="smcap">Army of the East</span>”
from Egypt, and the detachment returned, in January,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
1801, to Bombay, where Major-General Baird assumed
the command, and the expedition sailed for the Red
Sea.</p>

<p>It was originally designed, that the army from India
should land at <i>Suez</i>, a city of Egypt, situate at the head
of the Red Sea, on the borders of Arabia; and a small
squadron under Admiral Blanquett, having on board
three companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> (the grenadier,
light, and colonel’s companies) under Lieut.-Colonel
Lloyd, a detachment of Bombay artillery, a battalion of
sepoys, with other detachments, sailed some time
before the main body of the expedition, to attack Suez,
and interrupt the formation of any establishment there
by the French. This small force left Bombay in
December 1800, arrived at Mocha in the middle of
January 1801, where the fleet remained two days to
procure provisions, when it sailed for Jedda, where one
of the ships was lost on a bank. The navigation of the
Red Sea, from Jedda to Suez, proved particularly difficult
and tedious, on account of the want of a sufficient
depth of water, the fleet having to anchor daily, and
take advantage of the tides. On reaching Suez, the
French had evacuated the place in consequence of the
arrival of the army from Europe, under General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, on the Mediterranean shores of
Egypt, and the success of the British arms near Alexandria,
where Sir Ralph Abercromby was killed.</p>

<p>The troops landed at Suez, and Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd,
in reporting his arrival, solicited permission to cross the
Desert and share in the dangers and honours of the
army, which was advancing up the Nile, and approaching
Cairo, the modern capital of Egypt, which it was
expected the French would defend. Lieut.-General
Hutchinson acquiesced in Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd’s wishes,
and preparations were accordingly made to pass the
Desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>At six o’clock, on the evening of the 6th of June,
the three companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> commenced
their march, with only three pints of water per man;
the distance in a straight line, was only fifty-eight
miles; but the Arab Sheiks, furnished for guides by
the Vizier, and made responsible for the safe passage of
the detachment, represented that a detour of ten or
twelve miles would be necessary to prevent the French
intercepting the detachment.</p>

<p>After marching two hours over a hard sandy country,
Captain Cuyler, Lieutenant Morse, and Lieutenant
Goodfellow, were taken so ill as to be unable to proceed.
At eleven the troops halted for two hours, then
resumed the march until seven in the morning, when
they again halted, having performed twenty-six miles
of the journey. The day became so intolerably hot,
that Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd ordered the tents to be
pitched to shelter the men from the sun; but at ten
o’clock the guides stated it was necessary to march, as
the camels would be so debilitated by the heat, if they
rested on the sand, as to require water before they
could move again; but if kept in motion they would not
be affected in so fatal a degree; adding, if the soldiers
slept, the camel drivers might steal the water, which
they feared would be found scarcely sufficient. The
guides being responsible for the safety of the detachment,
Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd acceded to their wishes;
the tents were struck at eleven, and the march resumed;
the thermometer being at 109. Captain Cuyler soon
fainted again, and fell from his horse, and a camel and
two men were left to attend him and bring him forward.
The men beginning to drop fast in the rear,
Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd halted about one o’clock, cut his
own baggage from the camels, which example was
followed by all the officers, as many men as could be
carried were then mounted on the camels, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
whole proceeded. At two o’clock a camseen, or south
wind began to blow, the thermometer rose to 116,
and afterwards much higher; the officers and soldiers
were seized with dreadful sensations:—some were
affected with giddiness and loss of sight, and others
fell down gasping for breath, and calling for drink. At
four o’clock, Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd was forced to halt.
The skins had been cracked by the sun, and the water
had become of a thick consistence; the men who
drank it were seized with vomiting and violent pains.
The officers had brought with them some Madeira
wine, which they divided among the soldiers; a proportion
of spirits were mixed with the remaining water,
which was issued to the men, accompanied with
the warning, that every drop was in their own possession,
half the journey had not been performed, and on
their own prudence, in reserving a portion in their
canteens, must depend whether or not they should be
enabled to accomplish the remainder of the distance.</p>

<p>Between six and seven o’clock the wind ceased; as
the sun declined, the air became more temperate, and
the detachment being a little refreshed, though still <ins class="corr" id="tn-16" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'a langour pervaded'">
a languor pervaded</ins> the whole, the order for marching
was given at seven o’clock. Seventeen men, unable
to travel, were left on the ground, and camels were
left to bring them forward as soon as they could be
moved.</p>

<p>During the march several officers and soldiers
experienced an extraordinary sensation of seeing
horses, camels, and all kinds of animals, moving with
rapid transition before them, which false perception
their judgment could not correct. At eleven the detachment
halted; the night was excessively dark, and
the officers and soldiers were so exhausted, that unconquerable
sleep seized upon all.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the guides awoke Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Lloyd, and the soldiers formed in order of march with
difficulty, a heavy dew having fallen upon them, and
their limbs being benumbed with cold. The march
was, however, resumed; the south wind began to blow
at the same hour as on the preceding day, but the men
were not affected in the same severe degree; and by
strenuous exertions the detachment arrived at the
springs of Elhanka, between four and five o’clock in
the evening of the same day, when the joy experienced
by every one was very great. By eight o’clock all the
camels had come up, and the men, who, from giddiness
had fallen from their backs, joined during the night.
Eight of the seventeen men left behind, joined on the
9th of June, and the other nine perished in the Desert.</p>

<p>No man had partaken of food after quitting Suez,
as it would have increased the thirst, and the rations of
salt pork were thrown away on the first morning. On
arriving at the springs, the soldiers partook of the water
with caution; but two officers’ horses having broke
loose drank till they died on the spot. During the
march of seventy miles, no vegetation, bird, or beast,
had been seen.</p>

<p>After halting at the springs of Elhanka until the
evening of the 9th of June, the detachment commenced
its march in the dark, to prevent being discovered
by the enemy, and at eleven o’clock on the
following day, it joined the Turkish army, encamped at
Chobra, under the Grand Vizier; the British, under
Lieut.-General Hutchinson, being encamped on the
other side of the river Nile. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
pitched their tents with Colonel Stuart’s division, which
was with the Vizier’s army; the soldiers had suffered
the loss of their uniforms, which had been burnt in
consequence of the plague, and they had been forced to
abandon their knapsacks on the march; being very fine
men, their appearance excited great interest. On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
16th, the three officers left behind on the march,
joined; they had returned to Suez, and afterwards
passed the Desert with a caravan.</p>

<p>Advancing towards the metropolis of modern Egypt,
the army made preparations for investing that extensive
fortress; but on the 22nd of June a flag of truce
arrived from the French Commandant, General Belliard,
who agreed to surrender <i>Cairo</i>, on condition of himself
and garrison being sent back to France.</p>

<p>On the surrender of Cairo, the three companies of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> marched into the citadel, which the
French had evacuated a few hours previously. On the
same day they took possession of Fort Ibrahim.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the other three companies of the
regiment which had returned from Ceylon to join the
expedition, had been delayed by the difficult navigation
of the Red Sea, and had landed at Cosseir, from whence
a march of above one hundred and twenty miles had to
be performed across the Desert to Kenna on the Nile.
This distance was divided into stages, stores were
formed at several points, relays of camels were placed
to convey water, wells were found, and others digged,
and the march was performed by the army with much
less suffering than was experienced by the three companies
under Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd, in the passage of
the Desert from Suez to the springs of Elhanka. At
the third stage, called Moilah, some soldiers of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> dug a well at the foot of a hill, under
the direction of Captain Middlemore, and found an
excellent spring, for which they received the thanks of
the commander of the forces.</p>

<p>Arriving on the banks of the Nile, the troops embarked
in boats and proceeded down the river to the
island of Rhonda, where they encamped, while the
forces from Europe were engaged in the siege of <i>Alexandria</i>.
At Rhonda the six companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></span>
were united; four companies remaining in
India.</p>

<p>In the beginning of September, Alexandria surrendered;
Egypt was thus delivered from the power of
the French “<span class="smcap">Army of the East</span>,” and Europe saw
the dawn of liberty in the horizon. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
received, in common with the other corps which
served in this enterprise, the approbation of their
Sovereign, the thanks of Parliament, and the royal
authority to bear on their colours the <span class="smcap">Sphynx</span>, with
the word “<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>,” to commemorate the share taken
by the regiment in this splendid achievement.</p>

<p>To perpetuate the remembrance of the services
rendered to the Ottoman Empire, the Grand Seignor
established an order of knighthood, which he named
the order of the <span class="smcap">Crescent</span>, of which the superior
officers of the army and navy were constituted members.
The officers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and other
corps, had gold medals presented to them by the Grand
Seignor, which they were permitted by King George
III., to accept and wear.</p>

<p>The object of the expedition having been accomplished,
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> sailed up the Nile in boats,
in order to return to India; they arrived at El Hamed
on the 14th of October, and on the 30th proceeded to
Gheeza, where they remained several months.</p>

<p>In April of this year, one of the four companies
left in India, proceeded from Bombay to Surat, a town
situate on the south bank of the river Taptee, in the
province of Guzerat; and in November, two companies
sailed for Dieu in the same province.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>The two companies at Dieu returned to Bombay in
February, 1802, and in March they sailed to Cambay,
under the command of Captain Richardson, and joined
the company from Surat, which had arrived there a
short time previously. They encamped at Cambay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
with part of the Seventy-fifth, five companies of the
Eighty-fourth, a battalion of native infantry, and some
artillery, under Colonel Sir William Clarke.</p>

<p>The jealousy of the native chiefs at the accession
of territory acquired by the British in India, often
produced hostilities, and circumstances occurred which
occasioned a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, under
Lieutenant William Purcell Creagh, to take part in an
attempt to surprise the hostile fortress of <i>Kareah</i>, one
hundred and twenty miles from Cambay, on the night
of the 17th of March. The soldiers were advancing
to storm the place with the greatest gallantry, when
their progress was arrested by a deep ditch, cut through
the rock a short time previously, and the Arabs in
garrison being numerous and prepared, opened a heavy
fire. Lieutenant Creagh was killed by a cannon ball,
while in the act of leading the soldiers to the attack;
Lieutenant Lovell was also killed, and many officers
and soldiers were wounded; soon after day-break the
troops were obliged to retire.</p>

<p>In consequence of this repulse, the three companies
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, with the other detachments
encamped at Cambay, were ordered to advance upon
<i>Kareah</i>. The enemy having formed for battle a short
distance from the fort, with a numerous force, were
routed by the British on the 30th of April; and immediately
afterwards the town was captured, also some
out-works, in one of which an explosion took place,
killing an officer and twenty-five soldiers.</p>

<p>The siege of the fort was commenced; but when
the batteries opened their fire, the garrison surrendered.
The chief, Mulhar Rao, was sent a prisoner to Bombay.
After placing a garrison in the fort, the troops marched
for Surat, (170 miles,) where they arrived on the 12th
of June, having captured <i>Tarrapore</i>, and other small
places, while on the march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>The six companies of the regiment in Egypt remained
at Gheeza until May, when they traversed the
Desert to Suez, and from thence to “Moses’ Well,” or
the “Font of Moses,” on the Arabian side of the Gulf
of Suez. While at Gheeza they received two hundred
and seven volunteers from the Twentieth, Thirty-fifth,
Forty-eighth, and Sixty-third Regiments; Major Henry
Torrens joined at that station.</p>

<p>While at Moses’ Well, several soldiers died of
the plague, when the men’s clothing, bedding, and
tents were burnt, and the six companies embarked for
India; no other cases of the plague occurring, the
companies landed at Bombay on the 4th of July. In
November, the three companies arrived from the province
of Guzerat, and the regiment was once more
united at Bombay.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were only permitted to enjoy
a short repose at Bombay: the hostile demonstrations
of some of the predatory states composing the Mahratta
power, rendering it necessary for the British
forces to be held in readiness for active operations, and
assembled on the verge of the British territory. The
Mahratta states were united by a sentiment of interest
founded upon their common origin, civil and religious
usages, and habits of conquest and depredation; the
chiefs acted as independent sovereigns, but nominally
acknowledged the supreme authority of the
Peishwah. They, however, viewed with jealousy the
treaties between the British and the Peishwah, as
tending to restrain their predatory habits, and prevent
their acquisition of power; and this acknowledged head
of the Mahratta states found his independence controlled,
and the existence of his government menaced
by the violence and ambition of his feudatory chieftains;
at the same time he was unable to fulfil his
engagements with the British, the safety of whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
possessions was endangered. In consequence of these
events, connected with other causes, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
left Bombay in the middle of November, for the province
of Guzerat, and landed at Cambay, from whence
they marched towards the hostile fortress of <i>Baroda</i>, in
the vicinity of which place they encamped, with several
other corps, on the 3rd of December. An enemy’s
force was assembled to protect the fortress, and on the
18th of December the British advanced, leaving their
tents standing, and engaged their opponents. During
the fight the garrison made a sally; but the English
proved victorious, routing their adversaries with great
slaughter, and capturing a pair of Arab colours and
many prisoners.</p>

<p>During the night the erection of batteries commenced;
on the 21st of December the fire of the
artillery was opened, and the flank companies of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> stormed an outwork, defended by Arabs,
who refused quarter, and were nearly all destroyed, very
few escaping. In four days the breach was practicable,
and the storming parties were ready; but the garrison
surrendered. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> had seven men
killed, and twenty-three wounded in these services.
Captain John Grant distinguished himself during the
siege, and at the storming of the outwork.</p>

<p>Towards the end of this year, the usurpations of
Jeswunt <ins class="corr" id="tn-22" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Rao Holkur, one'">
Rao Holkar, one</ins> of the Mahratta chiefs,
forced the Peishwah to abandon his capital, and to
seek British aid, when a treaty was concluded with
him; and the refractory chiefs persisting in aggression,
hostilities were commenced to reinstate the deposed
chieftain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>On the third of February, 1803, three companies of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, under Captain James Richardson,
were detached, with other forces, the whole commanded
by Major Holmes, of the Bombay army, in pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the Mahratta chieftain, <i>Canojee Rao Guickwar</i>, who
had taken the field with a considerable force.</p>

<p>While in quest of the enemy, the advance-guard of
the Seventy-fifth Regiment was suddenly attacked,
when emerging from a defile, on the 6th of February,
and overpowered, with a loss of many men and a gun.
The three companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, being at
the head of the column of march, moved forward, encountered
the enemy, and, by a determined charge,
routed the hostile forces, chasing them across the bed
of a river into the jungle, where they dispersed, leaving
their tents, baggage, camels, horses, and the captured
gun behind. The regiment lost very few men in this
gallant exploit.</p>

<p>On the same day five companies of the regiment,
under Captain Cuyler, marched from Baroda to reinforce
Major Holmes’ detachment, leaving two companies
behind under Captain Grant.</p>

<p>The Chief Canojee was at the head of a considerable
force, but he avoided an engagement, which occasioned
many harassing marches in endeavouring to
come up with him. On the 25th of February, a party of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> was detached against the fort of
<i>Kirrella</i>, which was captured without experiencing
serious opposition.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, when near <i>Copperbund</i>, information
was received that Canojee’s force was not far
distant; and by extraordinary exertions, the detachment
came up with the hostile bands, which were in
full retreat. The Mahratta horse, attached to the
British detachment, did not act with spirit; but the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, though nearly exhausted with the
march, made a gallant effort, and encountered the
enemy, who was in the act of passing the bed of a
river. The adverse bands being nearly all cavalry, and
the British nearly all infantry, the enemy escaped with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
little loss. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> had two men killed;
Lieutenant Alexander Grant, and a few men wounded.</p>

<p>The forces of Canojee Rao Guickwar having been,
in a great measure, dispersed, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were
allowed a short period of repose; and these districts
were annexed to the British possessions in India.</p>

<p>Operations having commenced for the restoration of
the Peishwah, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were stationed a
short time in Guzerat, where a force was detained to
afford security to that valuable and important province,
and also a reserve disposable for active operations.
The regiment formed part of the disposable
force stationed in front of Brodera, the residence of the
Guickwar, and to the northward of the Nerbudda river.</p>

<p>In May, the regiment advanced and pitched its
tents before the fortress of <i>Keira</i>, belonging to one of
Doulat Rao Scindia’s chiefs, where some native infantry
and battering guns also arrived; but the garrison surrendered
without waiting for a breach having been
made in the works.</p>

<p>From Keira the regiment marched to Nerriade,
where it was joined by two companies left at Baroda
under Captain Grant; but the rains setting in, the
operations were suspended.</p>

<p>Information having been received that a body of the
enemy was levying contributions about thirty miles
from the quarters of the regiment, Captain Grant performed
a forced march with four companies and some
sepoys, and making a night attack with great success,
killed and took prisoners many of the enemy, and
captured some horses, &amp;c. Lieutenant Procter and a
few men of the regiment were wounded on this
occasion.</p>

<p>A body of Canojee’s troops threatening to cross the
river about fifteen miles <ins class="corr" id="tn-24" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'above Bareach'">
above Baroach</ins>, and plunder
the country, four hundred rank and file of the regiment,
with a battalion of sepoys, and four guns, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Captain James Richardson, advanced, on the 14th of
July, during the heavy rains, in search of the enemy.
The gun-bullocks failed, and the country being inundated
by the rains, the soldiers had to drag the guns,
up to their waists in water; but by extraordinary
efforts they arrived at the bank of the river on the 16th
of July, and attacking a number of Canojee’s troops
which had crossed the stream, routed them, and forced
them into the water, where many lost their lives, the
river being full and rapid.</p>

<p>The river having fallen considerably during the
night, the soldiers passed the stream on the following
day, under cover of the fire of the guns, and assaulting
the breast-works of the main body of Canojee’s legions,
carried them at the point of the bayonet, and pursued
the routed enemy two miles with great slaughter. A
body of Arabs disdaining to seek their safety in flight,
fought with great desperation until overpowered.</p>

<p>Captain Richardson and Lieutenant Lanphier distinguished
themselves on this occasion; and the enterprise
being accomplished with the loss of a few men
killed and wounded, the troops returned to Baroda.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the plan suggested to the Governor-General
by Major-General Hon. Arthur Wellesley, five
hundred men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, a small detachment
of the Sixty-fifth, a proportion of European artillery,
and a battalion of Sepoys, advanced, under Lieut.-Colonel
Woodington, to besiege the strong fortress of
<i>Baroach</i>. On the 23rd of August, this small body of
troops encamped on the bank of the river within a few
miles of the fortress, expecting the arrival of the battering
train in boats. The baggage of the regiment
was this day attacked by a numerous body of the
enemy’s horse, when nearly every soldier and follower
was killed or wounded, and the baggage captured and
plundered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>A schooner and gun-boat having arrived with cannon
and ammunition, the troops advanced on the 25th
of August, and arriving within two miles of the fortress,
discovered a numerous body of hostile cavalry,
infantry, and Arabs, in order of battle on the plain.
These opponents were speedily routed with the loss of
their flag and a number of killed and wounded; and
the armament soon afterwards attacked, and carried,
the pettah with great gallantry; Ensign D’Aguilar distinguished
himself on this occasion.</p>

<p>The siege of the fort was commenced, and a breach
was reported practicable; at one o’clock on the 29th of
August, the storming parties assembled in the streets
under the command of Major Cuyler; the bayonets
were firmly fixed by the introduction of a piece of
cotton cloth, to prevent the Arab swordsmen disengaging
them, and the soldiers proceeded quietly to their
post behind the battery. At three the signal to attack
was fired, and the forlorn hope, consisting of Serjeant
John Moore and twelve soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
sprang forward; a hundred soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
and a hundred Sepoy grenadiers, under Captain
Richardson, rushed towards the breach, followed by
three hundred men under Major Cuyler, and a reserve
of two hundred under Captain Bethune.</p>

<p>Passing the ditch knee-deep in mud, and climbing
the long steep and difficult ascent to the breach, the
soldiers encountered the Arab and Scindian defenders,
who made a desperate resistance. Hand to hand the
combatants strove for mastery, and amidst the clash of
steel and turmoil of deadly contest, many feats of
valour were performed. Captain Maclaurin, who
evinced great ardour, was wounded and made prisoner,
but he was rescued from the Arabs, by Private John
Brierly. Captain Richardson and Captain Grant signalized
themselves, and Serjeant Bills was conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
for the heroic courage with which he fought. At length
British valour proved triumphant, and the breach was
won, when the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> crowned the rampart,
the Scindian colours were pulled down, and the British
standard planted in their place, by Serjeant Moore.</p>

<p>Having overpowered all resistance at the breach,
Captain Richardson’s party swept the works to the
Cuttoopore gate; Major Cuyler led his detachment at
a running pace to the Jaraseer gate, and firing upon the
Scindians and Arabs who were escaping by that avenue,
wounded one of the elephants in the passage. The
Arabs threw down their matchlocks, drew their creesis,
and rushing upon their assailants with deadly fury,
refused to give or receive quarter. The contest was of
short duration; British discipline and prowess were
again victorious; two hundred Arab horsemen and foot
lay on the ground, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> stood
triumphant on the scene of conflict. Among the
trophies of the day, were fifteen stand of Scindian and
Arab colours, which were sent to head-quarters, excepting
two, retained by the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> regiment,
as trophies of the valour displayed by the corps on
this occasion.</p>

<p>Thus was captured a fortress of great importance to
the commercial interests of Britain, with a territory
yielding a considerable revenue, which were added to
the British dominions. In his public despatch, Lieut.-Colonel
Woodington highly commended the conduct
of Major Cuyler and Captain Richardson, and added,—“The
whole of the officers and men employed on this
service have conducted themselves so much to my
satisfaction, that I cannot express myself too strongly
in their commendation.”</p>

<p>The Governor-General in Council, also, signified in
general orders,—“his particular approbation of the
valour and judgment manifested by Major Cuyler, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
His Majesty’s <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> regiment, throughout
the service at Baroach, and in commanding the
storm of the fort, and by Captain Richardson of the
same corps, leading the assault. His Excellency in
Council, also, observes with particular satisfaction the
conduct of Captain Cliffe, of the Engineers of Bombay.
To all the officers and troops, European and Native,
employed on this honorable occasion, His Excellency
in Council signifies his high commendation.”</p>

<p>Serjeant Bills was rewarded with the appointment
of serjeant-major; Serjeant Moore received a donation
of five hundred rupees from the Government for his
gallantry, and Private Brierly was promoted corporal,
and afterwards serjeant.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment was Captain William
Semple, killed in the breaching battery on the 25th of
August—an excellent officer, whose fall was much regretted;
also two serjeants and ten rank and file
killed; Major Cuyler, Captain Richardson, Captain
Maclaurin, and twenty-three rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>From Baroach the regiment proceeded to Baroda,
from whence five hundred rank and file of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
a battalion of Sepoys, some irregular horse, and
a battering train, marched to attack the fort of <i>Powanghur</i>,
situated on a stupendous rock of extraordinary
height and of difficult ascent. Arriving before this
place on the 14th of September, and the garrison
refusing to surrender, the walls were battered until the
17th, when orders were issued to prepare to attack the
lower fort by storm. The garrison was intimidated by
the knowledge of the fact, that if they defended the
breach, their communication with the fort on the top
of the mountain would be cut off, and their escape
rendered impossible; they therefore surrendered. Thus
a fort of great strength by nature and art fell into the
hands of the British.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>The district of Champaneer, the only territory remaining
to Scindia, in the province of Guzerat, had
thus been reduced, and annexed to the British dominions.
Lieut.-Colonel Murray, of the Eighty-fourth
regiment, assumed the command of the troops at Baroda,
and advanced towards Scindia’s territories, in the
province of Malwa, in quest of Holkar’s forces, but it
was found impossible to bring the armed bands of that
chieftain to action. On the 18th of October the city
and fortress of Godera was taken possession of, the
enemy retiring as the British approached. At this
place information was received of the victory of Assaye,
gained by the troops under Major-General the Hon.
Arthur Wellesley, on the 23rd of September, which
was followed by the submission of two of the hostile
chiefs, Scindia and the Rajah of Berar, leaving Holkar,
Canojee, and some minor chiefs in the field.</p>

<p>Leaving Godera, the troops took possession of
Balinsanere in the beginning of November; and advanced
towards <i>Lunawarrah</i>. On the march, the rearguard,
consisting of five companies of Sepoys, and
some native cavalry, was suddenly attacked, while
passing through an extensive jungle, by a numerous
body of the enemy in ambush.</p>

<p>The hostile bands did not venture to attack the Europeans
of the advance-guard, nor the column, but rushed
with great fury upon the native troops in the rear,
occasioning the loss of many Sepoys and camp followers,
with some baggage, before assistance could arrive
from the column. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> had several
men killed and wounded on this occasion.</p>

<p>Lunawarrah was evacuated by the enemy, and
<i>Dhowd</i> was taken, about six weeks afterwards, with
little opposition.</p>

<p>In this part of the country, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and
other corps, with Lieut.-Colonel Murray, remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
about two months<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, watching Holkar, who had power
to concentrate an overwhelming force, which rendered
vigilance particularly necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>On the death of Lieut.-General Grinfield, King
George III. conferred the colonelcy of the regiment on
Lieut.-General Sir James Henry Craig, K.B., from the
Forty-sixth Foot, by commission dated the 5th of
January, 1804.</p>

<p>From Dhowd, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and other corps
under Lieut.-Colonel Murray, retired to Godera, and
from thence to Jerode, in order to obtain supplies, and
protect the province of Guzerat. At this period a
dreadful famine raged in the Deccan, and other parts
of the country hitherto the seat of war.</p>

<p>After three weeks’ repose at Jerode, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
Sixty-fifth, Sepoys and native cavalry, advanced
once more into the province of Malwa, under
Lieut.-Colonel Murray, and arrived at Dhowd on the
12th of June, having lost many men from the excessive
heat. On the march Major Stuart, of the Sixty-fifth,
died and was buried, (9th June,) under the colours of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, on which day twenty-one men of the
Sixty-fifth, and eleven of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, died from
the effects of the hot winds.</p>

<p>From Dhowd, the troops advanced to Ongein, the
capital of Scindia, from whence the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
three battalions of Sepoys, a train of artillery, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
body of Scindia’s cavalry, were immediately pushed
on to Indore, the capital of Holkar’s dominions, where
they arrived on the 14th of August; the city having
been evacuated on the previous evening.</p>

<p>From Indore, the flank companies of the regiment,
and a battalion of Sepoys, advanced with scaling
ladders, under Captain Richardson, twenty miles, to
surprise a fort, which was reported to be full of troops
and provisions; but when the soldiers scaled the walls,
they found the place empty; the enemy having fled a
few hours previously.</p>

<p>Having penetrated so far beyond the boundaries of
Guzerat, the troops under Lieut.-Colonel Murray found
their communication with that country cut off, and
Holkar threatening to enter and lay waste the province;
their supplies were nearly exhausted; they were in a
territory devastated by famine and disease; the rainy
season was approaching, and a small force, under Lieut.-Colonel
Monson, sent by General Lord Lake to effect
a junction with Lieut.-Col. Murray, was pursued by
Holkar’s numerous legions, and forced to make a
precipitate flight, abandoning its cannon and baggage.
Under these circumstances, a sudden advance was made,
of two marches, to deceive the enemy, and on the third
march the troops faced about and retreated. The rain
set in with such violence as to destroy the tents;—the
artillery and baggage oxen and camels died in great
numbers;—much of the baggage was abandoned;—the
soldiers had to drag the guns through the cotton-grounds
waist-deep in water;—no cover or shelter
for officers or soldiers;—the inhabitants dying in great
numbers from famine;—the European soldiers dying also
from excessive fatigue, the inclemency of the weather
and privation;—the native troops and followers also
perishing in great numbers: such were the distressing circumstances
under which this retrograde movement was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
executed, but, by the perseverance of the Europeans, the
guns were preserved, and the troops arrived at Ongein,
where the Sixty-fifth, <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and artillery,
were accommodated with a building in the fort. This
force had been reduced by its sufferings, from six to
three thousand men.</p>

<p>Exertions were made to re-equip this diminished force
for the field, and orders being received to advance, it
was again in motion in the middle of October, advancing
in the direction of Kota and Rhampoorae, and capturing,
on the route, the hill fort of <i>Inglehur</i> by escalade,
also several other small forts.</p>

<p>The army of Holkar was routed and dispersed by
the troops under General Lord Lake; but the war was
protracted by the defection of the Rajah of Bhurtpore,
and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were destined to transfer their
services to the rajah’s dominions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>Reinforcements having arrived from Bombay, Major-General
Jones assumed the command, and marched
towards the city of <i>Bhurtpore</i>, the capital of the
hostile rajah’s territory<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. After a long and harassing
march, the troops approached that fortress on the
10th of February, 1805, when a large body of hostile
horsemen surrounded the column and impeded its
movements across a level country. Half the force
was employed in protecting the baggage, and the
guns were repeatedly unlimbered, to keep the adverse
cavalry at a distance. On the following day, Major-General
Jones’s division joined the army before
Bhurtpore, and was inspected by Lord Lake, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
expressed his satisfaction at the bearing of the troops.
The soldiers of the Sixty-fifth and <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
presented a motley appearance: their worn-out uniforms
were patched with various colours, or replaced
by red cotton jackets; many of the men wore sandals
in the place of shoes, and turbans instead of hats; but
beneath this outward war-worn appearance, the innate
courage of Britons still glowed.</p>

<p>The siege of Bhurtpore had unfortunately been undertaken
without a battering train of sufficient weight, and
necessary to insure the reduction of so strong a fortress;
the siege was, however, persevered in. At three o’clock,
on the 20th of February, two hundred and fifty men of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and two companies of Sepoys,
commanded by Captain Grant, of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
stormed an out-work, covering one of the principal
gates, with the bayonet, driving the Arabs, who fought
with their usual determination, into the city, and capturing
eleven brass guns; in which service Lieutenants
Lanphier and D’Aguilar distinguished themselves, the
former receiving a spear wound in the neck. As the
Arabs fled to the gate, Captain Grant followed, in the
hope of being able to enter with them, but he found it
closed, and, after destroying the fugitives, who were
shut out, he retired to the Pettah, to await the result
of the other attacks, which did not succeed. While the
soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> and Sepoys were dragging
the captured guns to the camp, they were attacked
by a numerous body of the enemy, who issued from
the fortress to retake the guns, but were repulsed by
the steady valour of the soldiers. Captain Grant
formed a square round the guns, and under a heavy
fire from the Fort, succeeded in bringing them to
camp; this was the only successful part of this attack.
The enemy’s numerous cavalry also attacked the British
camp, but were defeated by the troops not engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the trenches, or in the assault. Lord Lake commended
the determined bravery of the storming party of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> in orders, and directed the captured guns
to be placed in front of the camp of the regiment,—a
mark of distinction highly prized by the corps, and by
the Bombay division of the army to which they belonged.</p>

<p>At three o’clock on the following day, the flank
companies of the Sixty-fifth and <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, supported
by the Seventy-fifth and Seventy-sixth regiments,
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Monson, stormed
a large and high bastion. After passing the ditch, the
forlorn hope was destroyed in attempting to ascend
the breach, which was extremely steep, and knee-deep
in mud and loose stones. Every effort was
made, the men climbing over the dead bodies of their
comrades, and struggling to gain the rampart, but in
vain. Some strove to climb by the shot holes made
by the British guns, and others drove their bayonets
into the mud walls to ascend by, while the enemy
above hurled large stones, logs of timber, packs of
flaming oiled cotton, and jars filled with combustibles,
upon their heads, with a terrible destruction; the killed
and wounded lay by hundreds, crushed beneath the
falling timbers, or burning under the flaming oiled
cloth, when Lieut.-Colonel Monson, seeing the impossibility
of succeeding, ordered the survivors to return
to the camp.</p>

<p>In the two attacks, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> had two
serjeants and twenty-three rank and file killed; Captain
Moreton, Lieutenants Travers, Baird, Lanphier,
D’Aguilar, one serjeant, one drummer, and seventy-three
rank and file wounded. A great number of the
wounded soldiers died. Lieutenant Baird received five
wounds; Lieutenant Lanphier was wounded on each
day; this officer and Lieutenant D’Aguilar distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
themselves on both occasions. Serjeant George Ibertson
was commended in regimental orders for his conduct
at the breach, and Corporal Crawford was rewarded
with the rank of serjeant, for his behaviour on this
occasion.</p>

<p>The capture of Bhurtpore without additional means,
being found impracticable, the British withdrew from
before that fortress, and proceeded to Dhoolpore;
negotiations for peace having been concluded, the
army was broken up in May; the Bengal troops proceeding
to Muttra, and the Bombay division to Tonk,
where they remained during the monsoon in huts.</p>

<p>After the rainy season, the Bombay force commenced
its march, proceeding through the territories of
the Rajah of Jeypore, in pursuit of the forces of Holkar,
who was still in the field. Having been chased to the
banks of the Hyphasis river, on the borders of the
great desert, the Mahratta chieftain was forced to submit,
and the war was terminated by a treaty of peace<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>In orders dated Riapoora Ghaut, on the left bank
of the Hyphasis, 13th December, 1805, General Lord
Lake returned thanks to Major-General Jones, the
officers, and soldiers, of the division of the army from
Bombay, for the important services rendered by them
during the war; and, alluding to the period they had
been under his immediate command, added, “His
Lordship has been proud to witness, on every occasion
on which they have been employed, the steady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
conduct and gallantry in action of all the troops composing
the division.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>From the banks of the Hyphasis, near the spot
where Alexander the Great crossed that river when he
invaded India, the regiment commenced its march for
Bombay, where it arrived on the 29th of March, 1806,
and embarking for Goa, landed on the rock of Aguada
on the 3rd of April, after a most active and harassing
service of more than five years, during which period it
had sailed up the Red Sea, crossed the desert twice,
served a campaign in Egypt, traversed the north and
western provinces of India from Bombay to Bhurtpore,
and received the thanks of Lord Lake on the banks of
the Hyphasis; having sustained a loss of Lieut.-Colonel
Robinson, Captains Maclaurin and Macquarrie, Lieutenants
Harvey, Price, and Wilson, Ensigns Massey,
Ellison, McKay, Leovick, and upwards of a thousand
non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>In October of this year, Lieutenant-General Craig,
K.B., was removed to the Twenty-second Foot, and was
succeeded in the colonelcy of the <i>Eighty-sixth</i> by
Lieut.-General Sir Charles Ross, Baronet, from the
Eighty-fifth regiment.</p>

<p>At Goa, the regiment was joined by a detachment,
consisting of Lieutenant Michael Creagh, Ensigns
Blackall, Hillhouse, Paymaster Cope, and thirty non-commissioned
officers and soldiers. This detachment
was employed under Major-General Sir David Baird, at
the capture of the Cape of Good Hope, in January,
1806, when Lieutenant Creagh was wounded. The
strength of the regiment was also augmented with two
hundred and thirteen volunteers from the Seventy-seventh,
on that corps embarking from England.</p>

<p>In this year, His Majesty was pleased to change the
designation of the corps to the “<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth, or
Leinster Regiment of Foot</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Hastings Fraser, having arrived in
India, overland from Europe, assumed the command,
and Major Cuyler embarked for England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>In February, 1808, Captain John Grant obtained
permission to return to England, when it was stated in
general orders,—“The Honourable the Governor in
Council cannot allow Captain Grant to depart, without
being accompanied by this testimonial to the
credit which that meritorious officer has done to the
British arms, during his service in India, at the siege
of Baroda, the capture of the important fortress of
Baroach and Powanghur, and particularly in the
arduous and successful attack of the column which
Captain Grant commanded on the 20th of February,
1805, at the siege of Bhurtpore, on which occasion,
he most gallantly carried the enemy’s post, and captured
the whole of their guns, being eleven in number,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>Orders having been received for the removal of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, to form part of a field force to be
assembled in the Presidency of Madras, the following
declaration was issued by the Viceroy and Captain-General
of the Portuguese possessions in Asia, dated
Palace of Panjam, 16th August, 1809.</p>

<p>“On the departure of His Britannic Majesty’s
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> regiment from Goa, His Excellency
the Viceroy and Captain-General of the Portuguese
possessions in Asia avails himself of the opportunity
to express his sentiments of praise and admiration of
the regular order and conduct which Lieut.-Colonel
Fraser, the officers and soldiers of that corps, have so
honourably observed during a period of three years,
which they have been employed in the territories
subject to his authority, so highly creditable to the
discipline of that corps.</p>

<p>“His Excellency the Viceroy will never forget the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
invariable harmony which has always subsisted between
the subjects of His Royal Highness the Prince
Regent of Portugal and all ranks of His Britannic
Majesty’s <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> regiment, whose remembrance
will be always grateful to him; and he doubts
not they will continue to acquire, in whatever part of
the world their services may be called for, glorious
claims on the rewards of their Sovereign, and the
admiration of their country.”</p>

<p>Leaving Goa, the regiment proceeded in boats up
the river to Candiaparr, from whence it ascended the
ghauts. <ins class="corr" id="tn-38" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'The moonson having set'">
The monsoon having set</ins> in, the men suffered
much from the incessant rains and inundations, and
after a long march through the Mahratta territories,
arrived at Bellary, on the 15th of September. The
second battalion of the First or the Royals, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
and two battalions of Sepoys formed the first
brigade, under Lieut.-Colonel Fraser, to which Lieutenant
Michael Creagh was appointed brigade-major. A
large force assembled under Colonel Conran, of the
Royals, but the native troops, against which it was
prepared to act, returned to their duty; when the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> garrisoned Bellary and Gooty. Captain
James Burke, and many non-commissioned officers and
soldiers, died from the effects of the fatigues they had
undergone. Soon afterwards, the regiment returned to
Goa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>After a few weeks’ repose, the regiment was selected
to form part of an expedition against the French island
of <i>Bourbon</i>; it embarked on the 5th of March, 1810,
and sailed on the following day. On entering Cannonore
harbour, one transport struck on a rock, and was
lost. After calling at Quillon and Point de Galle, for
water and provisions, the fleet sailed for Madras, where
the regiment landed on the 13th of April, and encamped
at St. Thomas’ Mount. From Madras, the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
sailed under the command of Colonel Fraser, consisting
of the Sixty-ninth and <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> Regiments,
Sixth and Twelfth Madras Native Infantry, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
&amp;c., and on arrival at the Island of Roderiguez, Lieut.-Colonel
Keating, of the Fifty-sixth Regiment, assumed
the command, having with him a detachment of the
Fifty-sixth, and some Bombay Sepoys. The land
force was divided into three brigades; the first brigade
was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Hastings Fraser,
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, with Lieutenant Michael Creagh,
brigade-major; and the second brigade was under
Lieut.-Colonel Drummond, of the same corps, with
Lieutenant Richardson, brigade-major.</p>

<p>The van of the expedition, consisting of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> Regiment, one hundred and eighty
rank and file of the Sixth Madras Native Infantry,
a small detachment of artillery, and fifty pioneers,
under Lieut.-Colonel Fraser, of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
with difficulty effected a landing at Grand Chaloupe,
about one o’clock on the 7th of July. On gaining the
shore, the light company of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, under
Lieutenant Archibald McLean, supported by the grenadiers
under Captain Lanphier, dashed forward to drive
back parties of the enemy’s riflemen, who kept up a
harassing fire, and to secure possession of the heights;
which service was performed with great gallantry. The
other part of the regiment having landed, pressed forward
to the heights above <i>St. Denis</i>, and, as the sun
was setting, approached to within range of the enemy’s
batteries. The violence of the surf had become so
great that the other divisions could not land, and the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, in consequence, fell back to the heights,
where they were joined during the night, by the Sepoys,
pioneers, and artillery, with one 4½ inch howitzer.</p>

<p>At four o’clock on the morning of the 8th of July,
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> commenced descending the mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
leaving the Sepoys on the summit to defend the
rear; their advance-guard was soon discovered by the
enemy’s post, and at day-light the regiment was assailed
by a heavy fire of cannon, mortars, and musketry; at
the same time some of the enemy’s riflemen attempted
to gain the road on its right. The light company, supported
by the grenadiers, and followed by the regiment,
descended the mountain at a running pace. Two
columns of the enemy, having each a field-piece, and
being supported by the heavy guns of the redoubt,
opened a sharp fire of grape and musketry; but, as the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> arrived on the plain, they closed on
their adversaries with the bayonet. This spirited conduct
decided the contest; the opposing ranks, unable
to withstand the shock of steel, faced about and fled.
Their commandant, M. de St. Luzanne, escaped with
difficulty, and their second in command was wounded
and taken prisoner by Captain Lanphier.</p>

<p>The enemy attempted to re-form behind the parapet
of the redoubt, but they were pressed so closely by the
grenadiers, that they abandoned it, leaving a brass six-pounder
behind, which was immediately turned against
themselves. The haulyards of the flag-staff in the
redoubt were shot away, but Corporal William Hall, of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, climbed the staff under an incessant
fire of round-shot and musketry, and fixed the
King’s colour of the regiment to it. The French
soldiers viewed this daring feat with admiration, and as
he descended the staff unhurt, they raised a loud shout;
at the same time, the seamen of the fleet off the shore,
who had witnessed the gallant charge, hailed the well-known
flag of the regiment which waved on the
redoubt by a loud huzza, which ran from ship to
ship as they passed; at the same time the grenadiers
of the regiment stormed two batteries, capturing nine
twenty-four-pounders, a twelve-inch mortar, and a furnace
of red-hot shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>The position seized was held by the regiment, the
guns of the captured redoubt answering the incessant
fire of the enemy, until the arrival of additional troops.
At four o’clock the enemy attempted to retake the
redoubt, but were repulsed with the loss of their commanding
officer, who was taken prisoner. About this
time Lieut.-Colonel Drummond’s brigade arrived, and
the enemy sent out a flag of truce; Lieut.-Colonel
Keating having joined, the surrender of the island of
Bourbon to the British arms was concluded by him.</p>

<p>Colonel Fraser stated in his despatch, “I cannot
conclude without requesting permission to offer my
humble tribute of praise to the noble spirit which
animated every individual of my detachment; from
Major Edwards,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who commanded the regiment,
I received the greatest assistance; Captain Lanphier,
Lieutenant Archibald McLean, and every officer and
soldier of the corps, displayed the most ardent
valour, which must have been conspicuous to the
whole force off the coast, who witnessed their conduct.”
“To Lieutenant Creagh, my brigade-major,
I was highly indebted for his unremitted exertions
and attention to the duties of his station, from the
beginning of the service I was sent on, to the moment
when he was struck by a cannon ball, while he was in
the act of encouraging our artillerymen in the redoubt,
which, I fear, will deprive his Sovereign and his
country of the services of a most promising officer.”</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment on this occasion was
Lieutenant John Graham Munro<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, of the grenadier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
company, killed during the charge; Major Edwards,
(commanding the regiment,) Captain Lanphier, Lieutenants
Michael Creagh, (brigade-major,) Archibald
McLean, Blackhall, Webb, and White, wounded; also
three serjeants, two drummers, and seventy-five rank
and file killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The following statement appeared in regimental
orders on the 9th of July:—“It affords Major Edwards
great pleasure, in having received Lieut.-Colonel
Fraser’s directions, to confirm the appointment of
Captain Lanphier<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to the grenadier company, a distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to which that officer is well entitled for the
gallant manner in which he led the brave grenadiers
to the assault of the redoubt and batteries.</p>

<p>“The conduct of the light infantry under Lieutenant
Archibald McLean, has on all occasions been
equally distinguished, and Major Edwards sincerely
laments the severe wound that gallant officer has
received, but trusts he will soon be restored to the
service.</p>

<p>“Major Edwards has great pleasure in confirming
Lieutenant Blackhall’s appointment to the grenadiers;
he regrets the wound received by that officer,
but hopes it will not prevent his joining that company
which he animated by his zeal and example.</p>

<p>“The conduct of the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> Regiment,
is above all praise; they have fought the enemy with
every species of disadvantage and deprivation; they
have borne the latter without a murmur, and their
determined valour has achieved victory. In spite of
every obstacle, they have nobly sustained the character
of their country, and it will be gratifying to
their feelings to know that their gallant exertions
have been witnessed and applauded by the whole
of the British force off the shore.</p>

<p>“Major Edwards cannot conclude without expressing
his regret for the loss of Lieutenant Munro,
of the grenadiers, and the brave men who have fallen
on this occasion; their memory, however, will long
survive, and be held dear in the recollection of the
regiment. Most sincerely does he regret the severe
wound received by Lieutenant Michael Creagh; but
which, he hopes, will not deprive the service of that
valuable and gallant officer; and he trusts the wounds
received by Lieutenant White, will not long prevent
him joining the corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Corporal William Hall, who hoisted the King’s
colour on the redoubt, is appointed serjeant for his
gallant conduct, in the room of Serjeant Millan, killed.</p>

<p>“Private John Moore, of the light infantry, is
appointed corporal, for his gallant behaviour on the
8th instant.”</p>

<p>The conduct of the regiment was highly commended
in detachment orders by Lieut.-Colonel Keating.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th of July, the flank companies
of the regiment marched into St. Denis, and
entering the principal battery, struck the tricoloured
flag of France, and hoisted the King’s colour of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>; they were followed by the regiment,
when the French garrison grounded their arms and
embarked for the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>Representation having been made of the gallant
behaviour of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> at the reduction of
this island, the royal authority was given for their
bearing the word “<span class="smcap">Bourbon</span>” on their colours and
appointments, as a mark of their Sovereign’s approbation,
and to commemorate their gallantry on this
occasion.</p>

<p>Bourbon and the Isle of France had been blockaded
some time; the capture of the former emboldening the
British navy, a small fleet ventured within the Isle de
Passe, on the south-west side of the Isle of France,
where one British ship was burnt and sunk, and several
disabled, which gave the enemy a superiority at sea,
when their frigates menaced the batteries of Bourbon.
The “Africaine” frigate arriving from England short of
hands, Lieutenant W. Home, a serjeant, and twenty-five
men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> went on board, and this
frigate, and the “Boadicea,” having put to sea under
Commodore Rowley, came up with, and engaged, two
French frigates. The “Boadicea” was becalmed astern,
the “Africaine” fought the two French ships until Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Corbett and one hundred and sixty of his crew were
killed and wounded, when the frigate being a complete
wreck, she struck her colours, but Commodore Rowley
coming up with the “Boadicea,” the enemy made sail,
and the shattered frigate was towed into St. Paul’s.
Only three of the soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
escaped; six having been killed, and Lieutenant Home
and seventeen wounded.</p>

<p>In September, the “Ceylon” frigate, having Major-General
Abercromby and staff, also Lieutenant Clarke
and twenty-five men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, on board,
was captured by the “La Venus” French frigate, after
a severe action, in which both ships were dismasted;
but Commodore Rowley appeared in the “Boadicea,”
re-captured the “Ceylon,” and took the “La Venus.”</p>

<p>General Sir Charles Ross having been removed to
the Thirty-seventh Foot, was succeeded in the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> by Major-General the Honourable
Francis Needham, from the Fifth Royal Veteran
Battalion.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Hastings Fraser was rewarded for
his conduct before St. Denis on the 8th of July, with
the dignity of Companion of the Bath, the officers of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> regiment presented him with a
sword, and those of his brigade, in the Company’s
service, with a valuable piece of plate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were removed to the Isle of
France in March, 1811, that island having also been
captured, and were there joined by Ensigns J. Creagh
and J. Grant, Assistant-Surgeon Bell, and a few recruits
from Europe, being part of a detachment which had
been sent to India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>Orders having been received for the return of the
regiment to India, it sailed from Port Louis on the 9th
of January, 1812, and landing at Madras on the 21st
of February, encamped on the South Beach until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
departure of the Thirty-third regiment for England,
when it occupied Fort St. George where Captain Impey
and sixty-eight recruits were awaiting its arrival.</p>

<p>The gallant behaviour of the regiment during the
Mahratta war, and at the reduction of the island of
Bourbon, had been represented to their Royal Highnesses
the Prince Regent, and the Duke of York, then
Commander-in-Chief, who never failed to reward
merit in individuals or corps, was brought to their
notice, and in May, 1812, the royal authority was
given for this corps being styled the “<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth,
or Royal County Down Regiment of Foot</span>;”
at the same time the facing was changed from yellow
to blue, the lace from silver to gold; the Irish “<span class="smcap">Harp
and Crown</span>” was placed on the buttons, and the
“<span class="smcap">Harp</span>” was added to the distinctions displayed on
the regimental colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><ins class="corr" id="tn-46" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: '1814'">
1813</ins></div>

<p>In January, 1813, the regiment commenced its
march from Madras for Goa, but when ascending the
Pada-naig-droog Ghauts, it received orders to proceed
to Vellore, where Lieutenants Jacob and Kirkland,
Ensigns Munro, McLean, McQuarrie, Kennedy, and
McLoughlin, with two hundred and seventeen soldiers,
joined from England.</p>

<p>Captain Impey, (brevet-major,) and Lieutenant
White, died, in May, much regretted.</p>

<p>At the end of August the regiment left Vellore,
and marched through the Calistry country, a distance
of four hundred miles, to the fort of Masulipatam.
It was overtaken by the monsoon when on the march,
near the Kistna river, and for several days the soldiers
had to wade through the cotton-grounds, which occasioned
much illness in the regiment, and the loss of
several men after arriving in garrison at Masulipatam
in October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>In the mean time the war with France was being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
prosecuted in Europe with the utmost vigour, and the
strength of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> being considerably
above the establishment, in consequence of receiving
volunteers from the militia, His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent was pleased to order a <i>second battalion</i>
to be added to the regiment, in February, 1814,
and to bear date from the 25th of December, 1813.</p>

<p>The second battalion was formed at Hythe, under
the superintendence of Major Baird; it consisted of
four companies of fine soldiers, and in March they
proceeded to Colchester, under orders to embark for
Holland; but the abdication of Bonaparte, and the
restoration of peace, precluded the necessity of their
quitting England. The battalion returned to Hythe
in October, and afterwards proceeded to Deal, where
it was disbanded, two hundred and sixty officers and
soldiers embarking for India to join the first battalion.</p>

<p>Previous to this date, a detachment consisting of
Captain Michael Creagh, Lieutenants Home and Perry,
Ensigns Goold, Bradford, Caddell, Henry, and Moreton,
had joined at Masulipatam, bringing the new
regimental colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>In January, 1815, the left wing marched, under the
command of Captain Williams, for Hyderabad, to join
the force subsidized by His Highness the Nizam, and
arrived on the 2nd of February at the cantonment of
Secunderabad.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September, Major Baird, Captain
Edwards, Lieutenants McLaurin, Webb, Leche, and
Hodson, Ensigns Stuart, Law, Russell, Holland and
Home, with sixteen serjeants and two hundred and
thirty rank and file, (the effectives of the late second
battalion,) arrived at Masulipatam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>In January, 1816, the head-quarters were removed
to Hyderabad, where they remained nine mouths, and
afterwards returned to Masulipatam, where Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Chadwick had arrived, with forty-six recruits, from
England, in the preceding August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>During the period the regiment was stationed at
Masulipatam and Hyderabad, it performed much severe
duty in consequence of the numerous incursions into
the British territories of the barbarous hordes of predatory
horsemen, called <i>Pindarees</i>, whose plundering
enterprises, executed on swift horses, were conducted
so as to baffle the efforts of the troops sent to intercept
them. In 1817, the right wing at Masulipatam furnished
detachments in the field under Captains Williams,
Morrice, and Creagh, in the Ganjam district, on the
banks of the Kistna, and towards Vizagapatam; the
left wing was also frequently called out; but the movements
of the <i>Pindarees</i> were performed with so much
celerity, that few of these plunderers were captured.</p>

<p>Two of the Nizam’s sons rebelled, put several of
his adherents to death, and threatened to depose their
father; when the left wing of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, a
battalion of sepoys, and two guns, were ordered to enter
the city of Hyderabad, preceded by two battalions of
the Nizam’s regular infantry under European officers,
with two six-pounders. The Nizam’s battalions were attacked
by the insurgents in a narrow street, and overpowered,
with the loss of fifty officers and soldiers and
one gun. The light company of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>,
with sixty pioneers under Lieutenant James Creagh,
being in advance recovered the gun, and covered the
removal of the killed and wounded to a square, where
the two native battalions had retreated and taken post.
On the appearance of Europeans, the insurgents dispersed;
the rebel Princes surrendered and were sent
prisoners to the fort of Golconda, when order was
restored.</p>

<p>The left wing marched for Masulipatam during the
hot season, which occasioned several deaths. On one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
occasion, Lieutenant Taylor and two soldiers were interred
with difficulty, from the decomposed state of
their bodies, although they had been dead only a few
hours. On another occasion the guides led the column
by a wrong road, occasioning a long and harassing
march, which proved fatal to several men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>The flank companies marched from Masulipatam in
January, 1818, under Captain Michael Creagh, and
with two troops of native cavalry and a company
of sepoy grenadiers, proceeded to Datchapilly, on the
borders of the Nizam’s dominions, to protect the frontiers
from the depredations of the Pindarees.</p>

<p>Orders for the return of the regiment to England
were issued in 1816, but countermanded in consequence
of the hostile conduct of the Pindarees: they were
repeated in April, 1818, when the regiment commenced
its march for Madras, and when within one stage of
that place, the route was changed to Wallaghabad.
Previous to embarking the regiment was inspected by
Major-General Brown, commanding the centre division,
who expressed in orders,—“To Colonel Hastings
Fraser, his greatest approbation of the good conduct
and discipline of the regiment since it had been
under his command in the centre division, in the
attainment of which he had been so ably supported
by the officers of the corps.”</p>

<p>While the regiment was waiting to embark, the
“Orlando” frigate arrived at Madras, from <i>Ceylon</i>,
with an application from the governor, General Sir
Robert Brownrigg, for immediate aid to suppress the
hostile aggressions of the Kandians inhabiting the
interior of the island; the mortality among the European
troops, employed in the interior, being so great, as to
render further aid indispensable. The flank companies
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were completed to one hundred
rank and file each, and embarked on board the frigate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
to proceed on this service<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; they landed at Trincomalee
on the 12th of September, and made preparations for
penetrating the interior, during which time Major
Marston was taken ill.</p>

<p>From Trincomalee the flank companies of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> sailed, on the 18th of September, under
Captain M. Creagh, and landing on the 21st, encamped
near the fort of Batticoloe, where the sick men of the
Nineteenth and Seventy-third Regiments, sent from the
interior, were dying fast; a hundred had been buried
close to the tents of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and several
deaths occurred daily.</p>

<p>On the 25th of September, the flank companies
of the regiment again embarked in open boats, and proceeding
during the night up the lake, landed on the
following day at Mandoor, from whence they marched
through thick jungle, thirteen miles up a gradual
ascent, exposed to heavy rain, to the Mangalar river.
On the 29th they traversed twelve miles of uncultivated
ground, fording several streams, to the post of Chinna
Kandy, commanded by Lieutenant Robinson, of the
Nineteenth Regiment, whose detachment was suffering
severely from ague and fever.</p>

<p>Fifteen miles of rugged country, covered with underwood
destitute of roads, and infested with wild elephants,
were traversed on the 1st of October, to the
post of Kataboa, commanded by Captain Ritchie, of the
Seventy-third Regiment, who had buried nearly a
hundred men of his detachment at this place, and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the seventy Europeans left alive, the captain and
assistant surgeon were the only persons free from
fever. At this place the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were joined
by seventy rank and file of the Ceylon corps, under
Lieutenant Noonan, who was to act as interpreter and
guide.</p>

<p>The march was resumed on the 3rd of October,
through a wild region, where elephants, buffaloes, hogs,
and deer were seen in abundance, also pea and jungle
fowl, but no human beings, and on the 6th the two
companies arrived at Palwatee, together with Lieutenant
Stuart, of the Ceylon corps, and a chieftain and his
followers, who had joined on the preceding day.</p>

<p>Having arrived in the districts infested by the
insurgent Kandians, parties of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and
Ceylon corps, were out day and night scouring the hills,
and for three weeks the soldiers were actively employed
in the mountains searching for the haunts of the rebel
chiefs, and their followers,—pursuing them from place
to place,—taking many prisoners,—also making seizures
of muskets, bows, arrows, and other military stores.
Private Stanton, of the light company, was seized by an
elephant, which broke his musket, tore off his belts,
and threw him some distance into the jungle, causing
his death. During the absence of the parties, the camp
was attacked, by a body of Kandians, in the night, but
the skilful arrangements of the officers in charge preserved
the soldiers from injury, and the fire of a cohorn
put the insurgents to flight. Captain A. McLean died
from fever, much regretted.</p>

<p>The health of the soldiers suffered from excessive
fatigue, bad provisions, constant exposure to the sun,
rain, and heavy dews, and their legs and feet were
ulcerated with leech-bites,—every pool, stream, bush,
and blade of grass being infested with leeches, which
obliged the officers and soldiers to march barefoot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
with their trousers cut off at the knee, that they might
detect the leeches. Sickness increasing rapidly, and
all the Coolies,—natives of India who accompanied
the troops to carry provision, ammunition, &amp;c.,—being
attacked, Captain Creagh marched his men from the
low country, to the hilly districts, taking post at
Hotpeira, where Lieutenant Goold, with a small detachment,
had erected a shed, and collected a supply of
grain and cattle.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Goold proceeded with as many sick
as means of conveyance could be procured for, to
Badula, where the camp was frequently attacked in the
night by the wild elephants, the tents, huts, and sheds
destroyed, and several natives and followers killed;
but the soldiers all escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>Detachments were constantly employed day and
night searching out the haunts of the insurgent chiefs,
and making many captures, including the crown, jewels,
horse, and favourite elephant of the Kandian king.</p>

<p>Overthrown in every rencounter, and chased from
place to place with diminished numbers, the Kandians
lost all hope of success; the leaders in the insurrection
tendered their submission, the lower orders followed
their example, and tranquillity was at last restored.</p>

<p>In the mean time the eight battalion companies of
the regiment had arrived at the island of Ceylon, but
their services not being required, they returned to
Madras, leaving one company at Trincomalee.</p>

<p>The services of the flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
being no longer required, they were relieved by
the Ceylon corps, and marched to Badula, where, in
garrison orders, dated the 19th of November, the
following order appeared:—“Colonel McDonell performs
a pleasing duty in bearing his public testimony
of his entire approbation of the good conduct and
patience, which, (under so many trying difficulties,)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
have distinguished the detachment of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
Regiment. He requests Captain Creagh will
be pleased to convey to the officers and men, his unqualified
thanks for their services, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>From Badula the two flank companies, reduced to
five officers, two serjeants, two drummers, and sixty-six
rank and file, commenced their march on the 20th
of November; the periodical rains had set in, and
the rivers were so full and rapid, that much difficulty
was experienced. On arriving at Kataboa, Captain
Ritchie’s detachment was found nearly annihilated.
At this place an elephant was procured, to convey
the stores and men across the rivers; and the
march was continued to Chinna Kandy, where the
military establishment was found in a state of ruin.
Lieutenant Robinson had left the post sick,—the three
serjeants had died,—the defences were destroyed by
the wild elephants,—the building containing the provisions
was washed away by the rains, and the few
surviving men were unable to move: with much difficulty
a small supply was recovered from the wreck, for
the use of the detachment.</p>

<p>From these statements, some idea may be formed
of the vicissitudes of actual service, the casualties of
climate, the privations and sufferings which chequer
the career of those who embrace the military profession,
and the sacrifice of valuable life by which
colonial possessions are acquired and retained, and
many national benefits obtained and preserved<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>After a march of ten days, exposed to almost
incessant rain, the flank companies arrived at Mandoor,
where they halted forty-eight hours to recover, and
afterwards sailed down the lake to Batticoloe, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
whence they were directed to march, through a low
flat country almost covered with water, to Trincomalee,
instead of proceeding thither by sea, as had been
expected.</p>

<p>Two canoes and the elephant were sent forward;
the men proceeded forty miles in boats along the coast,
then landed and marched ten days, through a country
almost covered with water, with scarcely sufficient
ground to rest upon. The tents were destroyed by
the wet, and abandoned; the elephant proceeded in
advance, feeling for the rivers; the canoes, conveying
the sick, were dragged by Coolies and soldiers wading
in the water, and in this state the two companies
reached Cottiar bay, on the 18th of December. Boats
being in readiness, they embarked for Trincomalee,
and with difficulty crossed the bar; soon afterwards
the wind changed, the sea became rough, and it was
found impracticable either to prosecute the voyage, or
to return across the bar with leaky open boats. With
much danger and difficulty they gained a rock in the bay,
where the soldiers passed the night, huddled together,
menaced with being swept off when the tide arose, and
destitute of provisions and fresh water. The wind and
rain abating, they again embarked on the following
morning, and on arriving at the inner harbour, were met
by the boats of the ships of war, which had been cruizing
for them, but were unable, from the roughness of the
weather, to rescue them from their perilous situation,
on the preceding night. On passing the “Orlando”
frigate, the seamen cheered, but the soldiers gave a feeble
response. On landing, twelve men were sent to the
hospital, four lieutenants, one serjeant, two drummers,
and forty-seven rank and file, under Captain Creagh,
in rags, their feet and legs bare, and ulcerated, emaciated
and tottering from exhaustion and hunger, entered
the fort; the pitiable remains of two hundred picked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
men, who marched out only three months before,
forming two fine flank companies equal to any service.</p>

<p>On landing, Lieutenant William Home, found his
brother, Ensign Home, dead in the hospital. Ensign
Home belonged to a battalion company of the regiment,
part of which was detached at Minnery,—a most unhealthy
post, where nearly all the non-commissioned
officers and soldiers had died.</p>

<p>Two days after the arrival of the flank companies of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, from the interior, a General Order
was issued, in which the Commander of the Forces in
Ceylon expressed his “acknowledgments to Major
Marston, Captain Creagh, and to all the officers and
soldiers of that distinguished corps, for the gallant and
important services rendered by them in suppressing the
Kandian rebellion, at the same time, he cannot conceal
the deep regret he feels at the severe loss which
has fallen on the detachment, and the death of a gallant
officer, Captain Archibald McLean, and many
brave soldiers.”</p>

<p>General Sir Robert Brownrigg also states, “Captain
Creagh’s gallant and most useful services in the command
of the flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
Regiment, during the Kandian war, under very trying
circumstances, was such, as to entitle him to the
favourable notice of His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief,
and to the best commendation I can
bestow on him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>On the 15th of January, 1819, the detachment
embarked, and, after putting to sea, was driven back by
contrary winds, but landed at Madras, on the 5th of
February, and joined the regiment at Poonamalee, on
the same evening. The health of the party was not re-established,
and Lieutenant Caddell, Assistant-Surgeon
Bell, and several soldiers, died after their arrival at
Madras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>The period for the return of the regiment to Europe,
having arrived, the following statement appeared in
General Orders, dated Madras, 6th March, 1819,—“The
Lieut.-General has traced with gratification, the
well-earned tributes of applause, bestowed by successive
governments, and commanders, in commendation
of the numerous instances of gallantry and efficiency
displayed during the active and varied service in
which His Majesty’s <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, or <span class="smcap">Royal
County Down</span> Regiment of Foot, has been engaged
since its arrival in the East Indies; and Colonel
Fraser, the officers, and men, are requested to accept
His Excellency’s thanks for the correct and orderly
conduct of the corps.”</p>

<p>In general orders by government, dated the 20th of
March, 1819, it was stated,—</p>

<p>“The meritorious conduct of His Majesty’s Twenty-fifth
Light Dragoons, and <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> Regiment
of Foot, in every situation where they have been
employed during the long period of their services in
India, has been brought under the notice of government,
in a particular manner, by His Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief, as establishing for them strong
claims to its consideration; and the honourable mention
which has been made by his Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief, has been coupled with the expression
of his Excellency’s wish, that their services
may meet with the same acknowledgment, on their
approaching departure, as, in general orders, dated
27th August, 1805, and 11th October, 1806, marked
the close of the distinguished career of His Majesty’s
Seventy-fourth Regiment, and Nineteenth Light
Dragoons, then returning to England; concurring
entirely in the commendations which His Majesty’s
Twenty-fifth Light Dragoons, and <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
Foot, have received from the Commander-in-Chief,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and entertaining the same high sense of their merits
and services, the Governor in Council is pleased to
extend, to the officers of those corps, the indulgence
recommended by his Excellency, and, accordingly,
directs that a donation of three months’ full batta be
passed to them on the occasion of their embarkation
for Europe.”</p>

<p>Five hundred and sixty non-commissioned officers
and soldiers having volunteered to remain in India,
transferring their services to other corps, the remainder
of the regiment sailed for England in April, and in
October anchored off the Nore, where the ship was
placed under quarantine, Lieutenant John Campbell
and several soldiers having died during the voyage.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of October, the regiment landed at
Gravesend, after an <i>absence from England of twenty-three
years and four months</i>, bringing back only
<i>two individuals</i>, <span class="smcap">Major D. Marston</span> and <span class="smcap">Quarter-Master
R. Gill</span>, who embarked with it in June,
1796, the latter as a private.</p>

<p>The regiment joined the depôt companies at Canterbury,
where Lieut.-Colonel John Johnson succeeded
to the lieut.-colonelcy, on the promotion of Colonel
Fraser, C.B., to the rank of major-general.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>During the winter, the regiment marched to Chichester,
sending two companies to Brighton, and in April,
1820, it was removed to Weedon and Northampton,
where two hundred and fifty recruits joined from Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821<br />1822</div>

<p>In February, 1821, the regiment proceeded to
Chatham; in October it embarked at Bristol, for Ireland,
and, after landing at Waterford, occupied quarters
at that place, having nine detached parties, until April,
1822, when the head-quarters were removed to Naas,
and in July, the regiment occupied Richmond barracks,
Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>From Dublin, the regiment proceeded, in May, 1823,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
to Athlone, and in October to Armagh, where the
authority of His Majesty, King George IV., was received
for bearing the word “<span class="smcap">India</span>” on the colours and
appointments, “in consideration of the distinguished
conduct of the regiment during the period of its service
in India, from the year 1799, to the year 1819.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824<br />1825<br />1826</div>

<p>In March, 1824, the head-quarters were removed to
Newry; in January, 1825, the regiment proceeded to
Naas; in June it was removed to Clonmel<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, and in
the spring of 1826, it marched to Buttevant,—furnishing
numerous detached parties. On quitting the
south-west district, Major-General Sir Charles Doyle
expressed, in a letter to the commanding officer, his
“entire satisfaction” at the conduct of the regiment,
while under his orders.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Johnson retired on half-pay, and was
succeeded as commanding officer, by Lieut.-Colonel
Mallett, C.B., from the Eighty-ninth regiment.</p>

<p>In the autumn, the regiment was formed into six
<i>service</i>, and four <i>depôt</i> companies, preparatory to its
embarkation for the West Indies<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. In October, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
service companies proceeded to Cork, leaving the depôt
under Captain Stuart, at Buttevant, and embarking on
board the “Princess Royal,” “Waterloo,” and “Thetis,”
transports, sailed for Barbadoes, from whence they were
ordered to Trinidad and Tobago, to relieve the Ninth
Regiment, which was about to return home. The
retirement of Major Baird occasioned Major Michael
Creagh to return from the West Indies, to take command
of the depôt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>At Trinidad, the regiment occupied the Orange-Grove
Barracks, until the completion of the new barracks
at St. James’s. During the year 1827, Ensign
Selway died at Tobago, and the loss by deaths, at the
two islands of Trinidad and Tobago, amounted to
three serjeants, forty rank and file, and eleven soldiers’
wives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>In January, 1828, the regiment was relieved by the
first battalion of the Royal Regiment, and proceeded to
the island of Barbadoes, where Adjutant Dolman, three
serjeants, and fifty-six rank and file, died of fevers contracted
at Trinidad and Tobago.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1829<br />1830</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Barbadoes during the
year 1829; in January, 1830, it was removed to Antigua,
St. Kitts, and Montserrat.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of December, Major W. Richardson
died at Antigua, universally regretted by the officers
and soldiers of the regiment, who testified their regard
for his merits, by erecting a monument to his memory
in the church of Newry, County Down. He was the
last of the three brothers who served with distinction in
the corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>In March, 1831, the slaves of Antigua, being
opposed to the abolition of the Sunday market, set fire
to several plantations, when a strong detachment was
sent to protect the town of St. John’s, where it remained
until tranquillity was restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>Colonel Mallet, C.B., after having assumed charge of
the civil government at St. Lucia, died at that island, very
much regretted by the regiment; and was succeeded, in
February, 1832, by Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Michael Creagh</span>,
from the half-pay, whose services are recorded in the
preceding pages.</p>

<p>In the spring of this year, His Majesty, King
William IV., was graciously pleased to approve of the
regiment bearing on its colours and appointments the
Irish “<span class="smcap">Harp and Crown</span>” and the motto “<span class="smcap">Quis
<ins class="corr" id="tn-60" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Separabit?” the harp'">
Separabit?</ins></span>”. The harp and crown only was assumed
when the corps obtained the title of <span class="smcap">Royal County
Down Regiment</span>.</p>

<p>During this year, detachments were employed in
controlling the disposition to violence evinced by the
slave-population at Tortola, Barbuda, and other places.</p>

<p>On the decease of General the Earl of Kilmorey,
the colonelcy of the regiment was conferred on Major-General
William George Lord Harris, K.C.B. by commission,
dated 3rd December, 1832.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>In February, 1833, the regiment was <ins class="corr" id="tn-60a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'removed to Demarara'">
removed to Demerara</ins> and Berbice, with detached companies at
Fort Wellington, Mahaica, and Fort D’Urban.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Sir Michael Creagh, K.H., arrived
from England, on the 1st of March, bringing with him
the new colours, presented to the regiment by the late
Earl of Kilmorey, bearing the “<span class="smcap">Harp and Crown</span>”
with the motto “<i>Quis Separabit?</i>” also the “<span class="smcap">Sphinx</span>,”
and the words “<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Bourbon</span>,” “<span class="smcap">India</span>;”—distinctions
reflecting honour on the corps, and calculated
to stimulate the youthful soldiers of the regiment
to emulate the noble example of their predecessors.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1834</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Demerara and Berbice
during the years 1834 and 1835.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835<br />1836</div>

<p>In December, 1835, Major-General Lord Harris
was appointed to the Seventy-third Regiment, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Major-General the Honourable Sir <ins class="corr" id="tn-61" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Frederic Cavendish'">
Frederick Cavendish</ins>
Ponsonby, K.C.B., was appointed to the colonelcy of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> Regiment. This officer was removed
to the Royal Dragoons, in March, 1836, and was
succeeded by Major-General James Watson, C.B.</p>

<p>From Demerara and Berbice, the regiment was removed
in May, 1836, to Barbadoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>On the 20th of February, 1837, the regiment was
inspected, preparatory to its return to England, by
Lieut.-General Sir Samford Whittingham, who stated
in a letter to Lieut.-Colonel Sir Michael Creagh, that
he had “reported the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, as about to embark
for England, after ten years’ service in the West
Indies, in a state of hardy, soldier-like efficiency, fit,
if necessary, for immediate service in the field: a
circumstance alike creditable to the commanding
officer and to the corps.” On the embarkation
of the regiment, on the 21st of March, the following
appeared in general orders:—“The Lieutenant-General
Commanding the Forces, having in person
witnessed the embarkation of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
Regiment this morning, it gives him sincere satisfaction
to express in general orders <ins class="corr" id="tn-61a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'his acknowlgements'">
his acknowledgements</ins>
of the soldier-like and orderly manner in which
it was conducted. The arrangements were perfect,
and the whole proceeding reflects the highest credit
on Lieut.-Colonel Sir Michael Creagh, the officers,
non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, of the Royal
County Down Regiment. They carry with them the
Lieut.-General’s best wishes for their future honour
and welfare.”</p>

<p>In May the service companies arrived at Chatham,
having sustained a loss of five officers, and two hundred
and ninety-nine soldiers, during the period they had
been absent from Great Britain, and bringing back
four hundred and twenty-four effective men. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
depôt companies arrived at Chatham from Ireland, on
the following day<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May, Lieut.-General Watson was
removed to the Fourteenth Foot, and was succeeded
by Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Brooke, K.C.B.</p>

<p>In June the regiment marched to Weedon, where
it was inspected on the 8th of August by General Lord
Hill, Commanding-in-Chief, who expressed to Lieut.-Colonel
Sir Michael Creagh, in front of the regiment,
his approbation of the highly efficient state of the
corps, after so long a service in the West Indies.</p>

<p>After the inspection, the regiment marched into
Lancashire, and occupied Salford-barracks, Manchester,
detaching one company to the Isle of Man. During
the Chartist disturbances, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> were
much employed, and frequently received the thanks
of Major-General Sir Charles Napier, and Colonel
Wemyss.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1838<br />1839<br />1840</div>

<p>In April, 1838, the head-quarters and flank companies
were removed to Stockport, in Cheshire; but
returned to Manchester, in June, 1839; and in June,
1840, the regiment embarked at Liverpool for Ireland,
and landed at Belfast; in September it was removed to
Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The regiment was employed in the summer of 1841,
at Templemore, Clonmel, Cork, and other places, aiding
the civil power in the preservation of the public peace,
during the election of members of parliament, and were
particularly thanked for their conduct and forbearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>The regiment received orders to form their depôt
companies preparatory to proceeding on service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>The Gazette of January 7, 1842, announced the
exchange of Lieut.-Colonel Sir Michael Creagh, K.H.,
with Lieut.-Colonel Derinzy, K.H., of the Eleventh
regiment.</p>

<p>At the period of the conclusion of this record, the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Royal County Down
Regiment</span>, is under orders again to proceed to India.
Although comparatively a young corps, it has performed
much valuable service to the country in all
quarters of the globe; it had not the good fortune
to serve in the Peninsular War, in which so many
corps acquired honorary inscriptions; but it has earned
distinctions for its colours, which furnish a powerful incentive
to perseverance in the path of duty and honor
to all who may have their names recorded in the books
of this distinguished regiment.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><i>Appointed 30th October, 1793.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornelius Cuyler</span> was appointed ensign in the fifty-fifth
foot, on the 31st of May, 1759, and, immediately proceeding
to North America, joined his regiment before the <ins class="corr" id="tn-64" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'fort of Ticonderago'">
fort of Ticonderoga</ins>, on the west shore of Lake Champlain, in July
of the same year, in time to take part in the reduction of that
post. In 1760 he served at the reduction of Isle-aux-Noix
and at the capture of Montreal, which completed the conquest
of Canada. In 1764 he was appointed captain in the
forty-sixth foot, with which corps he served two years on
the frontiers of North America, one year at New York, and
eight in Ireland. On the breaking out of the American war
in 1775, he was appointed first aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General
Sir William Howe, who proceeded to Boston with
reinforcements. In 1776, he was promoted to major in the
fifty-fifth, but continued to perform the duty of first aide-de-camp
to Sir William Howe, then commanding-in-chief in
North America, and served at the reduction of Long Island,
the capture of New York, and the battle of White Plains.
He also accompanied the expedition to Pennsylvania in 1777,
and served at the battles of Brandywine, and Germantown,
and in November of that year he succeeded Colonel Meadows,
who was removed to the fifth foot, in the lieutenant-colonelcy
of the fifty-fifth, which corps he commanded in the retreat
from Philadelphia to New York in 1778, and was at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
battle of Freehold, under Lieutenant-General Sir Henry
Clinton. In November of that year he proceeded with his
regiment to the West Indies, and was engaged in the capture
of St. Lucie. He performed the duties of adjutant-general
to the troops in the West Indies, under Major-General
Christie, in 1781; he afterwards performed the duties of
quarter-master-general in the West Indies until 1784 when
he returned to England, and took the command of his regiment,
then in Ireland. In 1787 he was appointed to the
situation of quarter-master-general in the West Indies, which
he held until 1792, when he succeeded to the command of
the forces in the Windward and Leeward Islands. He commanded
an expedition against Tobago, and, having captured
the principal fort by storm, on the morning of the 15th of
April, 1793, the island submitted. Returning to England
soon afterwards, he was promoted to the rank of major-general,
and appointed colonel of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> Regiment,
then first raised, and styled “Cuyler’s Shropshire Volunteers.”
He was also placed on the staff of Great Britain, and in
April, 1794, he obtained the appointment of lieutenant-governor
of Portsmouth: in June of that year he was removed
from the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> to the sixty-ninth regiment. In
June, 1796, he was appointed commander-in-chief in the
West Indies, with the local rank of lieutenant-general; in
January, 1798, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general
in the army, and returned to England in May following.
In June he was appointed to the command of the
Sussex district; and in January, 1799, he was nominated
commander-in-chief in Portugal,—the government of that
country having refused to ratify a treaty of peace with
France, and agreed to receive British troops into the ports:
he returned to England in November, the greater part of the
troops being sent to the Mediterranean. The rank of general
was conferred on this distinguished officer in 1803; he was
also appointed governor of Kinsale, and, in July, 1814, he
was further rewarded with the dignity of <span class="smcap">Baronet</span>.</p>

<p>General Sir Cornelius Cuyler, Baronet, died at St. John’s
Lodge, Herts, on the 8th of March, 1819, after an honourable
service of sixty years.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><i>Appointed 20th June, 1794.</i></p>

<p>This officer was appointed cornet in the royal regiment of
horse-guards, in May, 1755; captain in the seventh dragoons,
in February, 1758, and in April, 1760, he was promoted
to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the twenty-first dragoons,
or royal foresters. He served in Germany under
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, and, at the peace in 1763,
when the royal foresters were disbanded, he was appointed
lieutenant-colonel of the second dragoon guards. On the
breaking out of the American war, in 1775, he was appointed
colonel of the nineteenth light dragoons,—then newly raised;
in 1777, he was promoted to the rank of major-general, and,
in 1782, to that of lieutenant-general; in 1783 his regiment
was disbanded. The colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> foot
was conferred on Lieutenant-General Manners in 1794; in
1795 he was removed to the twenty-sixth light dragoons,
and in 1799 he was promoted to the rank of general.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of May, 1800, as General Manners was riding,
accompanied by two other gentlemen, in a post-chaise, to
Cambridge, he was stopped by two highwaymen, who demanded
his money, when he shot one dead on the spot, and
the other rode off. In September of the same year, he was
residing at Southend, for the benefit of his health, and, having
a presentiment of his approaching death, he set off for
London, alone, to obtain medical advice, but he was taken ill
on the road, and died at an inn, at Billericay, in Essex, on
the 11th September, 1800.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 smcap">William Grinfield.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><i>Appointed 25th March, 1795.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Grinfield</span> was appointed ensign in the third
foot guards, in 1760; he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant
and captain in 1767, to that of captain and lieutenant-colonel
in 1776, and in 1782 he was promoted to the rank of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
colonel in the army. In 1786 he obtained the commission of
second major in his regiment. He commanded the first battalion
of the third foot guards, under His Royal Highness
the Duke of York, in Flanders, and evinced great personal
bravery and ability on several occasions, particularly at the
siege of Valenciennes, and at the re-capture of the post of
Lincelles on the 18th of August, 1793, for which he received
the thanks of the Duke of York in general orders. He had
been appointed lieutenant-colonel of the third foot guards a
few days before this action occurred, and in October of the
same year he was promoted to the rank of major-general.
In 1795 he was rewarded with the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
foot; in 1798 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general,
and at that eventful period he was called
upon to transfer his services to the West Indies, with the
important appointment of commander of the forces in the
Windward and Leeward islands. On the renewal of hostilities
with France in 1803, he commanded an expedition
against St. Lucie, and, having captured the fort of Morne
Fortuné by storm on the 22nd of June, the island submitted.
He landed on the island of Tobago on the 30th of June, and,
by a spirited advance upon Scarborough, forced the French
General, Berthier, to surrender. He captured the islands of
Demerara and Essequibo, from the Dutch, on the 19th of
September, and Berbice, in a few days afterwards. On the
25th of September he was promoted to the rank of general.
He died at Barbadoes on the 19th of October, 1803, of the
yellow fever, surviving his lady only three days. It is recorded,
that a short time before he left England for the West
Indies, Mrs. Grinfield’s brother died, leaving them £20,000;
the general, finding two cousins of the deceased were left
unprovided for, observed to his lady, that, as themselves possessed
an ample fortune, he purposed making provision for
the unfortunate relatives; she readily assenting, he sent for
them, and divided the whole legacy between them.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs100 smcap">Sir James Henry Craig, KB.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><i>Appointed 5th January, 1804.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Henry Craig</span> obtained a commission of ensign in
the thirtieth foot on the 1st of June, 1763, and he served
with his regiment several years at the fortress of Gibraltar.
In March, 1771, he was promoted captain in the forty-seventh
foot, with which corps he served in the American war. The
forty-seventh were at Boston when hostilities commenced;
they took part in the actions at Concord and Bunker’s Hill
in 1775, and in 1776 they served in Canada. In December,
1777, Captain Craig was promoted major in the eighty-second
regiment, then serving in America, and in 1781 he
obtained the lieutenant-colonelcy of that corps, from which
he was removed, in 1783, to the sixteenth foot. In 1790 he
was promoted to the rank of colonel, in 1794 to that of
major-general, and in 1795 his services were rewarded with
the colonelcy of the forty-sixth foot. In 1801 he was advanced
to the rank of lieutenant-general, and was removed to
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> regiment in 1804. On the 25th of March,
1805, he was appointed commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean,
with the local rank of general; he was also honoured
with the dignity of a Knight of the Bath, and nominated
governor of Blackness Castle; in 1806 he was removed to
the twenty-second regiment. The services of General Sir
James Craig were afterwards transferred to British North
America, of which country he was appointed governor, with
the local rank of general in Upper and Lower Canada, dated
the 21st of August, 1807. In 1809 he was removed to the
colonelcy of the seventy-eighth highland regiment, or Ross-shire
buffs. On the 1st of January, 1812, he was promoted

<p class="p1 pfs100 smcap">Sir Charles Ross, Bart.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><i>Appointed 30th October, 1806.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Ross</span>, son of Admiral Sir Lockhart Ross, of

dragoon guards, in which corps he remained three years,
when he was advanced to the commission of major in the
thirty-seventh foot. On the 16th of March, 1791, he was
promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy of his regiment, and he
performed the duty of commanding officer several years with
reputation to himself and advantage to the service. He
afterwards took an active part in raising the hundred and
sixteenth regiment, but this corps was disbanded in 1796.
On the 18th of June, 1798, he was promoted to the rank of
major-general, and to that of lieut.-general, in October, 1805.
In December of the same year, he was appointed colonel of
the eighty-fifth foot, from which he was removed, in October,
1806, to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>, and in June, 1810, he was
appointed to the thirty-seventh regiment. He was endowed
with many amiable qualities, which rendered him an
ornament to his country; he was eminently useful in every
relation which connected him with society, particularly
courteous in public life, and affectionate and valuable as a
friend. He died at Balnagown Castle, in the county of Ross,
on the 8th of February, 1814.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs100 smcap">The Honorable Francis Needham.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><i>Appointed 25th June, 1810.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Honorable Francis Jack Needham</span>, third son of
John, tenth Viscount of Kilmorey, choosing the profession of
arms, procured a commission of cornet in the eighteenth
dragoons, on the 17th of December, 1762; in February,
1765, he was removed to the first dragoons, in which corps
he obtained a lieutenancy in 1771, and in May, 1774, he
was promoted captain in the seventeenth dragoons. He
accompanied his regiment to North America, in the spring of
1775, and served at Boston under Lieut.-General Gage; he
also served at the capture of Long Island under General
Sir William Howe, and received, with his regiment, the
thanks of the Commander-in-Chief, for his conduct at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
battle of Brooklyn. He also served in the actions at White
Plains, and in the Jerseys; afterwards proceeded to Philadelphia,
took part in several skirmishes in Pennsylvania, and
in covering the retreat to New York, in the performance of
which service he was engaged at Freehold. He was subsequently
stationed in the lines in front of New York, where
he was taken prisoner by the Americans. In August, 1780,
he was promoted major in the seventy-sixth Highland regiment,
then serving in America, with which corps he shared
in the contest until the peace. In February, 1783, he was
promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy of the hundred and fourth
regiment, and six weeks afterwards he was appointed captain
and lieut.-colonel in the first foot guards; he was
nominated aide-de-camp to the King in 1793, with the rank
of colonel. In 1794 he was appointed adjutant-general of
the expedition to the coast of France, under Lieut.-General
the Earl of Moira; and in 1795 he was appointed third
major in the first foot guards, promoted to the rank of
major-general, and placed on the home staff. He was subsequently
detached, second in command to Major-General
Doyle, with Monsieur Compte D’ Artois and his suite, to take
possession of Isle Dieu, which place the troops maintained
so long as the navy could afford them protection. An appointment
on the staff of Ireland was next conferred on him,
and he commanded a body of troops during the rebellion in
1798; he was at the battle of Arklow, on the 9th of June,
and commanded a division at Vinegar Hill, on the 21st of
June. He continued on the staff of Ireland until April, 1802,
when he was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general. He
had previously been appointed lieut.-colonel in the first
foot guards (21st of August, 1801,) and in April, 1804, he
obtained the colonelcy of the fifth veteran battalion. In
1806, he was elected member of parliament for Newry, and
he sat for that borough in four parliaments. He was appointed
colonel of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span> Regiment in 1810, and
took great interest in the reputation and welfare of his corps:
in 1812 he was promoted to the rank of general. On the
decease of his brother Robert, in 1818, he succeeded to the
dignity of <span class="smcap">Viscount Kilmorey</span>. Large and influential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
estates in Ireland were bequeathed to him by a distant relation;
and in January, 1822, he was advanced to the dignity
of <span class="smcap">Earl of Kilmorey</span> and Viscount Newry and Morne, in
the County Down, Ireland. This excellent and patriotic
nobleman died at his seat of Shavington, in Shropshire, on the
21st of November, 1832, much regretted, particularly by his
numerous tenants in Ireland, to whom he had evinced great
kindness.</p>

<p>Removed to the seventy-third regiment of foot, 4th
December, 1835.</p>


<p class="p2 pfs100 smcap">The Honorable Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby,
KCB., GCMG., KCH.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><i>Appointed 4th December, 1835.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honorable Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby</span>, third son
of Frederick, third Earl of Besborough, was appointed cornet
in the tenth dragoons, in 1800, and rose, in 1803, to the
commission of captain in the same corps, from which he
exchanged to the sixtieth regiment, in 1806. In 1807, he
was appointed major in the twenty-third light dragoons, at
the head of which corps he distinguished himself at the battle
of Talavera, in 1809, and was promoted, in 1810, to the
lieutenant-colonelcy of the regiment. In 1811 he served
under Lieut.-General Graham, at Cadiz: and at the battle of
Barossa, in March of that year, he attacked, with a squadron
of German dragoons, the French cavalry covering the retreat,
overthrew them, took two guns, and even attempted,
though vainly, to sabre Rousseau’s battalions. On the 11th
of June, 1811, he was appointed lieut.-colonel of the twelfth
light dragoons; at the head of which corps he served under
Lord Wellington, and distinguished himself, in April, 1812,
at Llerena, in one of the most brilliant cavalry actions during
the war. At the battle of Salamanca he charged the French
infantry, broke his sword in the fight, and his horse received
several bayonet wounds. He repeatedly evinced great judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
penetration, and resolution in the out-post duty, and
was wounded in the retreat from Burgos, on the 13th of October,
1812. At the battle of Vittoria he again distinguished
himself: his services at Tolosa, St. Sebastian, and Nive were
also conspicuous; and, on the king’s birth-day, in 1814, he
was promoted to the rank of colonel in the army. He commanded
the twelfth light dragoons at the battle of Waterloo,
where he led his regiment to the charge with signal intrepidity,—received
sabre cuts on both arms,—was brought to
the ground by a blow on the head,—pierced through the back
by a lancer,—plundered by a tirailleur,—ridden over by two
squadrons of cavalry,—and plundered a second time by a
Prussian soldier; but afterwards recovered of his wounds.
His services were rewarded with the following marks of
royal favour:—Knight Companion of the order of the Bath,—Knight
Grand Cross of the order of St. Michael and St.
George,—Knight Commander of the Hanoverian Guelphic
order,—a cross,—a Waterloo medal,—Knight of the Tower
and Sword of Portugal,—and Knight of Maria Theresa of
Austria. In January, 1824, he was nominated inspecting
field officer in the Ionian Islands; he was promoted brigadier-general
on the staff of those islands, in March, 1824; and in
June, 1825, he was advanced to the rank of major-general.
He was removed to the staff of Malta, and retained the
command of the troops in that island until May, 1835. In
December, 1835, he obtained the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-sixth</span>
Regiment, from which he was removed to the royal
dragoons in the following year. He was an ornament to his
profession. In him, military talent was united with the most
chivalrous bravery,—calm judgment,—cool decision,—resolute
action, and modest deportment. He died on the 10th of
January, 1837.</p>

in the burial ground, with their caps off; on enquiring the cause,
a soldier of the grenadiers replied, “Your honour, we are come up
to see our old captain.” On joining the group, he observed the
tomb of his old and respected comrade, Lieut.-Colonel Lanphier,
and the following words, which had been scratched by the soldiers
beneath the inscription on the tomb-stone, “<span class="smcap">A Brave Soldier!</span>”
“Please your honour,” (the soldier continued) “the Boys of the
